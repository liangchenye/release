1. run `docker images`
And we might get:
``` 
REPOSITORY                      TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
ospaf/centos6-ntp               latest              5a0cfacbb77c        4 hours ago         247.8 MB
```

2. choose an `Image id`
./analyze-local-images 5a0cfacbb77c

And you will see the output
